# ShitHub
ShitHub is a collaborative platform, created to check your own and/or foreign code for security vulnerabilitys and design issues.

## Why ShitHub?
Q: Why should I support and later use ShitHub instead of other Code review systems like Upsource? 

A: Well, there are many other Code review systems, but we don't knew any system which isn't limited to team inside review and Open Source.
